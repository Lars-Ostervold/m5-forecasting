# Retail Analytics Dashboard

## Overview
This project is a fun exploration I built to enhance my skills in data science, machine learning, and interactive dashboard development. I wanted to create something that demonstrates end-to-end analytics capabilities using publicly available retail data, while learning modern tools and techniques used in the industry.

The requirements had to be split into two files since Streamlit gets angry when it has to install large packages like Tensorflow üòâ
